# LeetCode-Solutions
This is the repo that has all of the LeetCode competitive programming problems I've done!

**PLEASE NOTE**: That many of the problems on LeetCode have "given" code snippets that you have to work with, and more often than not their variable naming conventions are **awful**. So, if you see me using a variable just called "x" or "i1, i2, i3" know that I am using what was given to me and didn't have a choice.
